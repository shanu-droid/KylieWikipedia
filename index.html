    <p> <strong style="color:#250D3C;">Kylie Jenner</strong> was born in 1997 in California. Jenner grew up in the spotlight among her famous siblings in the reality series, <em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em>. She’s harnessed her family's fame to launch her own business ventures including a successful cosmetics line, Kylie Cosmetics, and earned millions from sales of her signature Kylie Lip Kit. Additionally, she’s amassed a mega social media following and in 2015 was named one of <em>Time</em> magazine’s Most Influential Teens. In 2019 she was highlighted by <em>Forbes</em> as the youngest-ever self-made billionaire.</p><h2 class="x">Career</h2>
    <p><strong style="color:#250D3C;">Keeping Up With The Kardashians:</strong> The release of a sex tape involving her sister Kim that garnered vast media attention, in 2007 the family debuted their reality television series <em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians on E!</em> The series, which featured many of the Kardashian clan, was so successful, it led to a number of spinoffs for some of the siblings, all of whom have etched a place in pop culture history.<br><br><strong style="color:#250D3C;">Rise of Kylie Cosmetics</strong>With the success and public interest in the series and their lives, Jenner and her siblings have expanded their individual brands beyond reality television, earning millions through the lucrative world of celebrity endorsements. She and her sister Kendall have launched a clothing collection for PacSun and TopShop called Kendall & Kylie. Jenner has also launched her own cosmetic brand, Kylie Cosmetics, which includes her wildly successful Kylie Lip Kit.<br> In 2015 the then 17-year-old socialite caused a media frenzy when she admitted to using “temporary lip fillers” (and sparked another frenzy in July 2018 when she revealed via Instagram that the fillers were gone). In 2015 she and Kendall were named to Time magazine’s Most Influential Teens list. That same year, she launched a paid lifestyle app called Kylie, which is estimated to generate millions of dollars for the young businesswoman. Additionally, like her sisters, Kylie Jenner has an extensive following on social media; on Instagram alone, she has garnered more than 100 million followers. She used this visibility to start a campaign on the social media site against bullying #IAmMoreThan. The campaign featured the personal stories of six people who turned their painful experiences of being bullied into something positive.<br><BR CLEAR="left" />
    
    

        Demonstrating her social media influence, after Jenner tweeted about her diminished interest in the Snapchat platform in February 2018, shares of its parent company dropped by 6.1 percent the following day, wiping out a whopping $1.3 billion in market value.<br>
        
        That summer Forbes featured Jenner on a cover to highlight its annual "richest self-made women" list. Coming in at No. 27 with a net worth of $900 million — well ahead of famous big sister Kim, at $350 million — Jenner's fortune was attributed to her 100 percent ownership of the successful Kylie Cosmetics brand.<br>
        
        In March 2019 Jenner again was featured in Forbes as part of its annual ranking of the planet's richest people. With her net worth up to $1 billion, the 21-year-old became the youngest member of the billionaires' club and the youngest-ever self-made billionaire, surpassing the mark once set by 23-year-old <strong style="color:#250D3C;">Mark Zuckerberg</strong>. Showing no signs of slowing down, she went on to launch her Kylie Skin skincare line in May.</p>
